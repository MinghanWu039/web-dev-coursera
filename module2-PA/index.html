                Reading, writing, speaking, and listening were cornerstones of 
                Western rhetorical studies for more than 2,000 years.

                But in the 20th century recovery of rhetoric within composition 
                studies, reading and writing reign as the dominant tropes for

                Indeed, listening has been neglected. That's not to say listening 
                has never been mentioned within 20th-century scholarship. It has.

                explore voices speaking or not speaking within written texts.
